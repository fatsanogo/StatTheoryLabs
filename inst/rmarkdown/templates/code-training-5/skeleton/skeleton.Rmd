## Code Annotation

1. Do an initial reading of each code chunk. Note any questions that pop into your head. If you do this inline, use a hashtag (#) to add a comment.
    
2. Identify any functions you do not understand and look them up using the help function `help(function_name)` or the "Help" tab in the bottom right pane. Make sure you understand the input paramters and the form of the output. 
    
3. Identify any overall structure. Is a subtask repeated multiple times? How many times?
      
4. For each object, predict their size. Check your intuition using `dim` or `length`. You may also want to use `class` to identify the type of an object.
    
5. Write a one to two sentence description of what the code chunk does that someone without a coding background could understand.

**Task**: Go through the code annotation steps on the following code chunk.

```{r}
sim.dataset <- function(n, mean_vals, sd_vals) {
  # Simulate X and Y variables:
  simulated_data <- data.frame(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean_vals[1], sd = sd_vals[1]),
    y = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean_vals[2], sd = sd_vals[2])
  )
  
  # Return dataset
  return(simulated_data)
}

```


## Write a function 

**Task**: Write a function to simulate sample data (for two groups) for your scenario. You may adapt the skeleton below

```{r}
sim.dataset <- function(n, mean_vals, sd_vals) {
  # Simulate X and Y variables:
  simulated_data <- data.frame(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean_vals[1], sd = sd_vals[1]),
    y = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean_vals[2], sd = sd_vals[2])
  )
  
  # Return dataset
  return(simulated_data)
}
```


## Test your function

**Task**: Test your function to make sure the result is what you expect.

```{r}
set.seed(1726)
test_data <- sim.dataset()

head(test_data)
dim(test_data)
```

## Plot your data

**Task**: Plot the distribution of each of your two datasets. Practice writing informative labels. Remember to load the `tidyverse` if you are using ggplot.

```{r}


```
