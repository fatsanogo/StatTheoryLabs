## Simulate Dataset

Here is my version of `sim.dataset` that you adapted last week.

```{r}
sim.dataset <- function(n, mean_vals, sd_vals) {
  # Simulate X and Y variables:
  simulated_data <- data.frame(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean_vals[1], sd = sd_vals[1]),
    y = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean_vals[2], sd = sd_vals[2])
  )
  
  # Return dataset
  return(simulated_data)
}

```

## Create a dataframe to store our power calculation results

**Task**: Refer to your response from the Project Checkpoint about power and/or the [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test) to refresh your memory about what we aiming to calculate in our simulation study.

```{r}
power.val <- data.frame(
  pval_param = rep(NA, 500),
  pval_nonparam = rep(NA, 500)
  )
head(power.val)
dim(power.val)
```


## Skeleton for a power function


1. Do an initial reading of each code chunk. Note any questions that pop into your head. If you do this inline, use a hashtag (#) to add a comment.
    
2. Identify any functions you do not understand and look them up using the help function `help(function_name)` or the "Help" tab in the bottom right pane. Make sure you understand the input paramters and the form of the output. 
    
3. Identify any overall structure. Is a subtask repeated multiple times? How many times?
      
4. For each object, predict their size. Check your intuition using `dim` or `length`. You may also want to use `class` to identify the type of an object.
    
5. Write a one to two sentence description of what the code chunk does that someone without a coding background could understand.

**Task**: Go through the code annotation steps on the following code chunk. 


```{r}
significance_value <- 0.05

simulate.power <- function(n.sims, n, mean_vals, sd_vals) {
  
  # Dataframe to hold results:
  power.val <- data.frame(
  pval_param = rep(NA, n.sims),
  pval_nonparam = rep(NA, n.sims)
  )
  
  # Simulating many tests:
  for (dataset.i in 1:n.sims) {
    simulated_df <- sim.dataset(n = n, mean_vals = mean_vals, sd_vals = sd_vals)
    res_param <- ## replace with your parametric test
    res_nonparam <- ## replace with your nonparametric test
    power.val$pval_param[dataset.i] <- (## res_param's pvalue
                                          < significance_value)
    power.val$pval_nonparam[dataset.i] <- (## res_nonparam's pvalue
                                            < significance_value)
  }
  
  # Aggregating into summary 
  power.val <- summarise(power.val,
                          param.power = mean(pval_param),
                          nonparam.power = mean(pval_nonparam))
  
  # Returning a summary dataframe
  return(power.val)
}
```

## Test the function

**Task**: Take the code you wrote from your Project Checkpoint to run the two tests and access the p-values in the places and replace the double comments denoted above. You should then be able to run and test the function below.

```{r}
set.seed(1726)
power_res <- simulate.power()

head(power_res)
dim(power_res)
```

## Simulate Dataset - Your Version

Now copy and paste your version of the `sim.dataset` function from the previous code training here.

```{r}


```

## Power Function - Your Version

Adapt the power function that runs above to use your `sim.dataset` function. The inputs may need to change.

```{r}


```

## Test your function

Test a case where you expect the null hypothesis to *not* be rejected and hence have a low power.

```{r}
set.seed(1726)
power_res <- simulate.power()

head(power_res)
dim(power_res)
```

Test a case where you expect the null hypothesis *to* be rejected and hence have a high power.

```{r}
set.seed(1726)
power_res <- simulate.power()

head(power_res)
dim(power_res)
```
