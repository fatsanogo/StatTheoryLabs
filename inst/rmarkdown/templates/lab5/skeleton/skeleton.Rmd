## Evaluation

Recall that I'm not going to grade the lab for accuracy, I will just check to see if you have made a good attempt at it. I will post solutions after grading, but it will be helpful to you if you try to work through the lab before checking the solutions.

You should definitely feel free to work through this with someone else and just submit one version of the lab.  In that case, just put both of your names at the top of the document. Make sure you and your partner submit on lyceum even if it is the same file.

## Lab start here

Today we will be looking at the normtemp dataset from [Journal of Statistical Education](https://jse.amstat.org/datasets/). We have measurements of the body temperature of 130 adults.

The code below will load the dataset into R.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)
bodytemp = read.table('https://jse.amstat.org/datasets/normtemp.dat.txt')
```

Let's plot the dataset bodytemp,

```{r}
names(bodytemp) <- c('temp', 'sex', 'hr')
ggplot(data = bodytemp, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
  geom_density()
```

We can see from the plot above that there is substantial variability in the body temperatures of adults.  If we model $X_1, \ldots, X_{130} \sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, this variability is described by the variance parameter $\sigma^2$.  Suppose we want to estimate that variance with a confidence interval.

### 1. Find a 95% confidence interval for $\sigma^2$ based on the sample data.

```{r}
```

### 2. Does your confidence interval from part 1 contain the true parameter value $\sigma^2$?

Pick one of the options below.

#### (a) Yes

#### (b) No

#### (c) There is probability 0.95 that it does, but we can't be sure.

#### (d) We can't be sure, and we also can't make a statement like "there is probability 0.95 that it does."  The best we can say is that if we were to repeat the process of taking samples and computing confidence intervals many times, about 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the actual value of $\sigma^2$.
