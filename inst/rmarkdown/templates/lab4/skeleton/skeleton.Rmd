## Evaluation

Recall that I'm not going to grade the lab for accuracy, I will just check to see if you have made a good attempt at it. I will post solutions after grading, but it will be helpful to you if you try to work through the lab before checking the solutions.

You should definitely feel free to work through this with someone else and just submit one version of the lab.  In that case, just put both of your names at the top of the document. Make sure you and your partner submit on lyceum even if it is the same file.

## Part I: Exploring Confidence Levels

Recall the level of confidence associated with an interval estimator is defined as the probability of the interval estimates containing the true parameter in repeated sampling.

That is, if we draw thousands of random samples from a distribution and compute thousands of 100(1-$\alpha$)% confidence intervals, approximately 100(1-$\alpha$)% of those intervals will contain the true parameter.

In this section, we are going to illustrate this idea via simulation. 


```{r}
# Set up a counter
counter <- 0

# Set up blank plot with specified ranges
plot(x = c(22, 28), y = c(1, 100), type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
# Draw a vertical line at mu = 25
abline(v = 25, lwd = 2)

for(i in 1:1000){
	# Generate the random sample of size 30
	# Remember, rnorm requires sd, not the var
	x <- rnorm(30, 25, 4)
	# Lower limit
	L <- mean(x) - qnorm(.975, 0, 1)*(4/sqrt(30))
	# Upper limit
	U <- mean(x) + qnorm(.975, 0, 1)*(4/sqrt(30))
	# Check if mu = 25 is in the interval
	# Increase the counter by 1 if yes
	if (L < 25 && U > 25){
	  counter <- counter + 1
	}
	# Plot first 100 intervals 
	# Interval will be green if it contains mu, red if not	
	color <- ifelse(L < 25 && U > 25, "green", "red")
	if (i <= 100){
	  segments(L, i, U, i, col = color)}
}

# Proportion of times interval contains mu
counter/1000
```

**Question 1 - Annotating Code**

a. Do an initial reading of the code in the chunk above. Note any questions that pop into your head. If you do this inline, use a hashtag (#) to add a comment.

b. Identify any functions you do not understand and look them up using the help function `help(function_name)` or the "Help" tab in the bottom right pane. Make sure you understand the input paramters and the form of the output. 

c. Identify any overall structure. Is a subtask repeated multiple times? How many times?

d. For each object, predict their size. Check your intuition using `dim` or `length`. You may also want to use `class` to identify the type of an object.

e. Write a two to three sentence description of what the code chunk does that someone without a coding background could understand.

**Question 2 - Adapting Code**

a. Adapt the following code to run a simulation that computes 90% confidence intervals instead.

```{r}
# Set up a counter
counter <- 0

# Set up blank plot with specified ranges
plot(x = c(22, 28), y = c(1, 100), type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
# Draw a vertical line at mu = 25
abline(v = 25, lwd = 2)

for(i in 1:1000){
	# Generate the random sample of size 30
	# Remember, rnorm requires sd, not the var
	x <- rnorm(30, 25, 4)
	# Lower limit
	L <- mean(x) - qnorm(.975, 0, 1)*(4/sqrt(30))
	# Upper limit
	U <- mean(x) + qnorm(.975, 0, 1)*(4/sqrt(30))
	# Check if mu = 25 is in the interval
	# Increase the counter by 1 if yes
	if (L < 25 && U > 25){
	  counter <- counter + 1
	}
	# Plot first 100 intervals 
	# Interval will be green if it contains mu, red if not	
	color <- ifelse(L < 25 && U > 25, "green", "red")
	if (i <= 100){
	  segments(L, i, U, i, col = color)}
}

# Proportion of times interval contains mu
counter/1000
```

b. What proportion of intervals contained $\mu$? Was it what you expected?

c. How do your intervals in this code chunk compare to those from the first code chunk?

**Question 3 - More Adapting Code**

Recall that since the data we were generating were iid from a Normal distribution, the sample mean has an exact Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard error $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ (this is the sampling distribution of the mean). When the data are not Normal, we can use the CLT to obtain the approximate sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ as long as the sample size is large enough and the variance is finite.

a. The first code chunk is copied and pasted here. Adapt it to run a simulation that computes 95% confidence intervals with data generated from a Poisson random variable with parameter $\lambda = 3$. Your sample size should be $n=5$. Note: we are using the CLT so there should not be any usage of `qpois`. Update the code comments to reflect what is now going on.



```{r}
# Set up a counter
counter <- 0

# Set up blank plot with specified ranges
plot(x = c(22, 28), y = c(1, 100), type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "")
# Draw a vertical line at mu = 25
abline(v = 25, lwd = 2)

for(i in 1:1000){
	# Generate the random sample of size 30
	# Remember, rnorm requires sd, not the var
	x <- rnorm(30, 25, 4)
	# Lower limit
	L <- mean(x) - qnorm(.975, 0, 1)*(4/sqrt(30))
	# Upper limit
	U <- mean(x) + qnorm(.975, 0, 1)*(4/sqrt(30))
	# Check if mu = 25 is in the interval
	# Increase the counter by 1 if yes
	if (L < 25 && U > 25){
	  counter <- counter + 1
	}
	# Plot first 100 intervals 
	# Interval will be green if it contains mu, red if not	
	color <- ifelse(L < 25 && U > 25, "green", "red")
	if (i <= 100){
	  segments(L, i, U, i, col = color)}
}

# Proportion of times interval contains mu
counter/1000
```


b. What proportion of your intervals contained $\lambda$? Should you be confident in your result? Why or why not?

c. Copy and paste your code chunk from 3a and adapt it to run the same simulation, but now with a sample size of $n=50$. 

d. What proportion of your intervals contain $\lambda$ now? How do your intervals change (between $n=5$ and $n=50$ for Poisson case)? Do you feel confident in your results now? Why or why not?

## Part II: Violating Assumptions

Recall that when we have iid data from $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and $\sigma$ is unknown, we can estimate it with the sample standard deviation $s$, and now have the following pivot:

$$\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$$
When the population is normally distributed, the t-confidence interval is exact: a $100(1-\alpha)%$ interval covers $\mu$ with probability $1-\alpha$, or equivalent, misses $\mu$ on either side with probability $\alpha/2$. Again, notice that this assumes that the underlying population is normal. So what happens if that is not the case?

**Question 4 - Using Coding Structure in New Context**

a. Goal: Count the number of times (out of 10^5) the 95% CI misses the mean $\mu = \alpha*\beta$ on each side when the data comes from the right-skewed gamma distribution with $\alpha = 5$ and $\beta = 2$. 

This goal should remind us of a familiar coding task.

Relevant pseudo-code:

- Generate a sample of size $n=20$ from a gamma distribution. Remember that the gamma functions in R have the reciprocal parameterization.

- Calculate the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval

- Now instead of seeing if $\mu$ is contained in the interval (like we did in Part I), break it into two steps. First see if the interval is below $\mu$ and increase a counter `tooLow` if yes. Then see if the entire interval is above $\mu$ and increase a counter `tooHigh` if yes.

- Calculate the proportion of confidence intervals that were too low and too high.

b. Repeat this simulation by changing the sample size to $n=250$. How does the sample size affect the frequency of missing $\mu$? 

Note: you should be using the distribution discussed under Part II.
